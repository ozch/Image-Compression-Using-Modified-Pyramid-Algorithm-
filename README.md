#Modified Gaussian Pyramid Compression 

Image quality and resolution decrease as level gets higher in Pyramid Compression where as the image size on disk is not affected.
For example, at level one the image size is reduced by 70-80 percent keeping the image quality acceptable where as at level 2 image size is reduced by only 2 -5 percent with noticeable loss in image resolution and quality.
Therefore, we are using modifying the Gaussian Pyramid Compression algorithm to only go to level 1 from where the image is reconstructed to give us nearly lossless compression.
